I am creating aws resouces using terraform built in modules here.

The terraform commands i use here
1. terraform init . # Downloads necessary provider plugins and sets up the backend for state management.
2. terraform fmt  . # recurrect the formate which we have written.
3. terraform validate  . # validate our terraform code syntax wise.
4. terraform plan  . # it shows what will be created after apply/ what we are going to create.
5. terraform apply . # finally it creates whatever we writter as a terraform code.
